<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ibrahim</h1>

I have been in the IT industry more than 2 years as a SDET  / Automation Engineer.

I graduated in industrial engineering.

My current company is called Hypnotes, I am working on a web-based application.

I have successfully tested web-based applications both manually and automatically.

I can create the automation framework from scratch.

My framework is Page Object Model Cucumber Framework.

Project management tool or bug tracking tool is Jira

My main programming language is Java. I have automated frontend with Selenium, Cucumber, JUnit and TestNG tools.

I am using Maven as build management tool to control and manage my dependencies. And I use SQL (Structured Query Language) for manual Database testing. I have used JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) tool for automating the Database testing.

And I use Postman application for manual API (Application Programming Interface) testing.  I use Rest Assured library for automating the API (Application Programming Interface)

I have also performed functional, Smoke and regression testing. 

I have used Jenkins for CI/CD (continuous integration) tool.

I am experience in using Git/GitHub. 
 
I have worked in an Agile-Scrum environment, so I am confident in all Scrum meetings.

I work well in teams because I am social and friendly. I have good communication skills and  I can quickly adapt to my environment. I believe that collaboration, coordination and being helpful are important elements in a team. Which fits with my patient and helpful personality. Last but not least I love learning, I am open to learn new things.


That is pretty much about me. Thank you.
